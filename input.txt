TYPES OF PARSING
There are two types of parsing:
i). Top-down parsing
ii). Bottom-up parsing
I). TOP-DOWN PARSING
Top-down parsing is a parsing strategy that finds the derivation of the input string from the start symbol of
the grammar.
There are two main approaches for top-down parsing:
a) Recursive descent parsing
b) Predictive parsing
a) Recursive Descent Parsing
It is a common form of top-down parsing that uses a parsing technique, which recursively parses the input to
make a parse tree from the top and the input is read from left to right. It is called recursive, as it uses
recursive procedures to process the input. The central idea is that each nonterminal in the grammar is
implemented by a procedure in the program.
Generally, these parsers consist of a set of mutually recursive routines that may require back-tracking to
create the parse tree.
Backtracking: It means, if one derivation of a production fails, the syntax analyser restarts the process using
different rules of same production. This technique may process the input string more than once to determine
the right production
